# Online-Library-Sysyem
The purpose of this application is to allow the users to access books virtually and put in requests instead of being physically present 
in the library. This application will eliminate tedious task of maintaining the book and borrower records into excel sheets. The library 
staff can use the application to keep track of the books and users who borrow the books. Also, can keep record of members and staff of the 
library.
